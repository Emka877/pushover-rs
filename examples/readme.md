# Before running the examples
* Create a `examples/data/credentials.ron` file
* Put the following inside that file:
```ron
// Don't rename the class
ExampleCredentials (
    // Put your user key here
    user: "",
    // Put your app token here
    token: "",
)
```
* Get some jpg image (not too large), and drop it in the data folder, give it the name "attachment.jpg"
