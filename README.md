# Pushover RS
## WIP
## Description
It's a Rust client library you can use to interact with the [Pushover](https://www.pushover.net/) messaging API.

[Pushover](https://www.pushover.net/) is a push notifications service. It can push messages to phones and browsers. They offer 10,000 free messages / month.

This client is unofficial and I'm in no way linked to Pushover.

## Documentation
Coming soon
